# ARM10 - How to reverse engineer

The ARM template are very powerful and useful, we can agree on that. However, something it could be hard to get started. In this tutorial you will learn tips and tricks to start from scratch with existing template or export the template from existing resources. 

Azure Quickstart Templates
--------------------------

Let's say you would like to create a website with a database or a simple Ubuntu Linux VM 18.04-LTS. Your are definitely NOT the first one to try this... So with the help of the community Microsoft maintains a Azure Quickstart Templates Gallery. It's available from [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates), of course, but also with a more friendly search and index directly from the azure website! Go visit [http://aka.ms/quickarm](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/templates/?WT.mc_id=learnARM-github-frbouche) And let's do some research...

From the search bar in the middle of the screen type something like: *simple Ubuntu VM*. You will now see multiple result matching those keywords. You can also search by resource type from the left, and change the order of the result displayed.

When you click on one of those result you will open the detail page where you will have a clear, easy to read list of the parameters, the commands in PowerShell and CLI to deploy the template. On the top of the page you will also find a 1-click deploy to Azure button and another one to bring you to GitHub to see the ARM files.
