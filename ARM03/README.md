# ARM03 - Parameters

In the previous tutorials we learn how to create resources using an Azure Resources Manager (ARM) template. However, it's was all static and defined *inside* the template.  In this tutorial you will learn how to use parameters to make your template dynamic and easier to use.

Parameter Types
---------------

To make our template dynamic we can pass some information when we call it using parameters. Remember the section parameters in the top of the templates?

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "parameters": {},
    ...
```
This is where we will define our parameters. There is multiple type of parameters but before we go list them and see some scenarios, let's understand how parameters are defined.

## Parameters Definition in Azure Resource Manager templates 

It's easy to thinks about parameters like a key pair value. Something like a parameters as a name and a value. But there is much more then that. Let's examine here our parameter section.

```json
"parameters": {
  "storageSKU": {
    "type": "string",
    "allowedValues": [
      "Standard_LRS",
      "Standard_ZRS",
      "Standard_GRS",
      "Standard_RAGRS",
      "Premium_LRS"
    ],
    "defaultValue": "Premium_LRS",
    "metadata": {
      "description": "The type of replication to use for the storage account."
    }
  }
}
```

There is one parameter define here named `storageSKU`. It's a string, but because we didn't when the users to write any values we used the `allowedValues` property to list the allowed value for our parameter. AllowedValues is an array of values of any types.

It's a good practice to used two other properties to help the user understand how to use our parameter: `defaultValue` and `description`.  The default value it's a way to say  to the user if you don't know just say nothing. It's an excellent way to make our template easy to use without compromising the flexibility.  Description, part of the metadata section, Is where of  course you give the most detail information about the  expected value and/ or the impact on the deployed resources.

To complement those there is also MinValue, MinLenght, MaxValue, and MaxLenght that will limits what's acceptable as value.

## Parameter Types

There is multiple type of parameter to accommodate the different type of information. We already mention the `string` type and other more also type like `int`, `bool`, and `array`.

Then there is `securestring` a very convenient way to pass a password for example. Using the securestring type will make sure the the information cannot be read after resource deployment.

Finally we have `object` and `secureObject`. With those you can define a complete object with many properties it's extremely powerful. And things become very flexible when you start mixing all those type together, like passing an array of objects! We will cover those scenarios in a next chapter.

## Using Parameters

Now that we know how to declare the parameters, it's time to see how we use them. This can easily be done by using a function name `parameters({parameterName})` that is included in ARM. This function will return the value of the "parameterName". For example `parameters('storageSKU')` will return "Premium_LRS". 

To use this function inside an ARM template we need to place it between square brackets `[]`. In the next sample we set the value of the property equal to the parameter.

```json\
{
   ...
    "name": "[parameters('storageSKU')]",
   ...
}
```

## Exercises

Now let's practice the things we learn in the little chapter. You can continue where you left at the previous chapter (ARM02 - Create first template) or start fresh with the files contained in the folder [begin-with]([begin-with/)

### ðŸ¥– Add the parameter storageSKU

Add the parameter **storageSKU** define at the top of this file, in the parameter section of the ARM template.


### ðŸ¥– Add the parameter storageName

Add a new parameter **storageName** of type `string`. It should have a description and a maximum length of ten characters.


### ðŸ¥– Use Parameters

All the parameter are defined, replace the hard-coded value of **storage SKU** and **storage Name** by their respective parameter.

To see if you have done successfully the exercises, compare your files with the once in the folder [end-with]([end-with/)
